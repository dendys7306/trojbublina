# trojbublina
Authoring tool for creating trojbubliny. What is it? And what can it serve?
Trojbublna is three circles centralized structure. Circle is the most crucial
and natural shape. View of the circles that are entered one to another is very
pleasant and comfortable display of conditionality - natural.  You can catch almost
evertihing to this structure and grasp the knowledge free and with amazing clarity.

The application itselve is very simple and strightforward. It runs as miniapps in Telegram
on the address http://t.me/ Ok, it is under a huge and rapid development. You can simply
create anything from the circles. Not just three circle schemas but also other useful
collections. See video below and some results.

The structure itself is self-sufficient and self-supporting. It is also formaly consistent
and contetionally universal but not reductional. So it can be used almost for any content
and the result will be usable. It tends to catch the truth naturaly. So the schmeses that are 
constructed within bad intentions will not work at all. It is infinite space for creativity
and as modernity says personalisation.  

## ideas of improvement

The concept itself is promising. Here is a list of main ideas of the improvements. Better say of branches
of development and growth. 
- moving scenarios (acvarium, random movement, interest model, implication basics...)
- building of multiuser space 
- - based probably on a kind of blockchain technology not necessary at the beginning
- - space for users, idea of canvas that will be filled with user represented by square
- - users will assign their examples to appropriate places of the trojbublina map
- creating input for printing trojbublina on t-shirt (png with transparent bkg and high resolution) 


## cooperation

If some feels that this concept is promising and has skills in css,html,javascript please join
the boat. At the moment I would like to keep the thing as much simple as possible. 
So the one file index.tml with all stuff is ideal. But if you like to do it in another way no problem.
You are pleased and welcome.
The current tasks are always somehow sumarized in opened issues.
